# GeoFs-Carrier-Catapults

**Please note this is forked from AriakimTaiyo's original project. Apparently he re-wrote about 85% of the code upon seeing my version, which is currently archived.**

The main code is meant to be injected into the console. The bookmarklet code has its own set of instructions.

Controls:<br>
